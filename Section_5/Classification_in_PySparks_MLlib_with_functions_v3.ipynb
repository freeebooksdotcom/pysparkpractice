    "# Classification in PySpark's MLlib\n",
    "\n",
    "PySpark offers a good variety of algorithms that can be applied to classification machine learning problems. However, because PySpark operates on distributed dataframes, we cannot use popular Python libraries like scikit learn for our machine learning applications. Which means we need to use PySpark's MLlib packages for these tasks. Luckily, MLlib offers a pretty good variety of algorithms! In this notebook we will go over how to prep our data, how to train and test the classification algorithms PySpark offers, and also some pretty neat functions that I created to make the model selection process really efficient. \n",

    "## Defining Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known (ie. supervised learning). You can think of classification like bucketing. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should use classification if your **dependent variable** (the variable you want to predict) is a **descrete value** (i.e. whole numbers like 1,2,3,4) typically the dependent variable will represent some class or group like types of flowers or colors, as opposed to a continuous variable like dollar amount, age or blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithms Available\n",

    "PySpark offers the following algorithms for classification. \n",

    "### Data Set Name: Autistic Spectrum Disorder Screening Data for Adult\n",
    "Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. Unfortunately, waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods. Therefore, a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis. The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behaviour traits. However, such datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with clinical or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature. Hence, we propose a new dataset related to autism screening of adults that contained 20 features to be utilised for further analysis especially in determining influential autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases. In this dataset, we record ten behavioural features (AQ-10-Adult) plus ten individuals characteristics that have proved to be effective in detecting the ASD cases from controls in behaviour science.\n",
